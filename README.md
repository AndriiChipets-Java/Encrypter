It is a final project of Java Syntax course (JavaRush).

My project implements classic Caesar cipher, there are only Latin letters in the alphabet.

BruteForce has been the most difficult thing which I had to do in this project, that is why it looks so difficult in my code.

In this project I tried to implement all my knowledge which I got from JavaRush and another courses.

I have made emphasis on project reliability. I tried to achieve this purpose by implementing the "Validate" class and many test classes. Also it is a cause why I have made Brute Force implementation by analyze key words and writing to file all possible variants, because if source file contains only one word, or several word, e.g. "Hello world", our program won't be working correctly.

My project has builded with implementation of SOLID principles.

JUnit tests and Mockito have been implemented in this project.

Oleksandr, could you pay attention especially on project structure and variables and method names, because it is my weakness, I think.It will be really helpful for me, if you give me some hint, how I can improve my skills.
